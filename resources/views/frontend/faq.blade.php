<div>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! No argument here. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be.
